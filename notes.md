# Notes

### SDL Rendering
So far, two types of Displaying techniques have been tested. Rendering and
image blitting. Image optimization so far has not worked when using rendering.
Not sure which one is better currently. The project currently uses rendering.

### Positioning
SDL uses a reverse coordinate system for placing objects. Origin is at the top
left, y increases while going down, and x increases to the right.
